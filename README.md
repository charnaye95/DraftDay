## User Stories
MVP
-A working full-stack application, built by you, using Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS (try this first)
-Adhere to the MVC file structure: Models, Views, Controllers
-At least one model (for NBA teams) with all 5 RESTful routes and full CRUD.
-A git repository inside my personal GitHub
-At least one Github commit per "day of class".
-Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku
-A README.md file

Stretch Goals
-I'd like to use Bootstrap
-I'd like to see if I can create a modal or another route for two players that can be compared by looking at both at the same time together side by side
-I'd like to add other models/databases for other sports

## Approach
Created models and set up database first. Then went one by one on the routes and CSS throughout.

## Unsolved Problems
I could not get my put route/update to work. I worked on it for hours, but to no avail. I will definitely have to come back to that to understand where the disconnect is.
