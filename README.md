Stretch Goals<br>

-I'd like to use Bootstrap<br>

-I'd like to see if I can create a modal or another route for two players that can be compared by looking at both at the same time together side by side<br>

-I'd like to add other models/databases for other sports<br>

-I'd like to increase the speed for the site, with all of the players its slow to load.<br>


## Approach
Created models and set up database first. Then went one by one on the routes and CSS throughout.

## Unsolved Problems
I want for the update route to update specific pieces individually, not the whole data. Because as of now if I leave something blank after updating it won't take in the info I had prior, it will return as blank.
